#### Do I need to sign up to use it?

**No.** &nbsp; You can use Plotly.py to render charts and maps without registering for any service,
obtaining any token, or creating any account. The one exception is that to render tile maps
which use tiles from the Mapbox service, you will need to have a Mapbox token. It is
possible to render maps which use tiles from non-token-requiring services such as Open Street Maps,
however.

#### Do I need to be connected to the internet to use it?

**No.** &nbsp; You can use Plotly.py to render graphics totally offline. The one exception is that to render tile maps
which use tiles from a cloud-hosted service, such as Open Street Maps or Mapbox, you will need a connection to that service.
You can render tile maps totally offline if you run your own tile server.
