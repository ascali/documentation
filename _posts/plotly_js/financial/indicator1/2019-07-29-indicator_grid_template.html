  In this tutorial we introduce a new trace named "Indicator". The purpose of "indicator" is to visualize a single value specified by the "value" attribute.
  Three distinct visual elements are available to represent that value: number, delta and gauge. Any combination of them can be specified via the "mode" attribute.
  Top-level attributes are:
    - value: the value to visualize
    - mode: which visual elements to draw
    - align: how to align number and delta (left, center, right)
    - domain: the extent of the figure

  Then we can configure the 3 different visual elements via their respective container:
    - number is simply a representation of the number in text. It has attributes:
    - valueformat: to format the number
    - prefix: a string before the number
    - suffix: a string after the number
    - font.(family|size): to control the font

   "delta" simply displays the difference between the value with respect to a reference. It has attributes:
    - reference: the number to compare the value with
    - relative: whether that difference is absolute or relative
    - valueformat: to format the delta
    - (increasing|decreasing).color: color to be used for positive or decreasing delta
    - (increasing|decreasing).symbol: symbol displayed on the left of the delta
    - font.(family|size): to control the font
    - position: position relative to `number` (either top, left, bottom, right)

    Finally, we can have a simple title for the indicator via `title` with 'text' attribute which is a string, and 'align' which can be set to left, center, and right.
    There are two gauge types: [angular](https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/) and [bullet](https://plot.ly/javascript/bullet-charts/). Let's fist look at one "angular gauge" example:

var data = [{domain: {x: [0, 1], y: [0, 1]}, value: 450, title: {text: "Speed"},
    type: "indicator", mode: "gauge+number"}];

var layout = {width: 600, height: 400};
Plotly.newPlot(gd,data,layout);
